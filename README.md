  # Description

  * This is a budget tracking PWA that I have created beginning with a starter code. This application will use IndexedDB to demonstrate offline functionality where a user can input an expense or deposit into the tracker despite internet connection. When used offline, the data will be stored until internet connection returns, upon which the user will receive a notification of success.
